## How to start in debug mode
Can be easily started using `run.sh` while on Linux or `qlerner.bat` while on Windows. The first one will build and start a docker container (as an alternative, you can use `start.sh` to pull from docker hub the docker image to run it), while the second will install all python requirenments, generate code, initialize data base, start up server and open the http://localhost:5000 for you.
